## Who?
Hi Everybody! 

![hello emoji](./pictures/hello%20emoji.jpg)

I am a student at UCSD currently studying Computer Science. Some of the langauges I have worked with include:

- Java
- C/C++
- Python
- Kotlin

Some of the **cool** things that I've done over the past years include some small personal projects, like [this](https://outisnomore.github.io/image-processing) very basic image processing toolkit, and helping graduate students by being their ~~minion~~ research assistant. All jokes aside, research was a very **rewarding _and_ interesting** insight into what sort of career options and paths are available as a developer. Having had some exposure on what it is like doing research, I hope to continue gaining experience through *internships* to see what it is like working in industry. In fact, my 1<sup>st</sup> priority at the moment is trying to find some opportunity to keep myself occupied with during the Summer.

### Username Background Story

My user name OutisNoMore is taken from the Odyssey. In the epic showdown between the cyclops Polyphemus and our very own hero Odysseus, the adventurer orchestrates a grand trick on the cyclops by introducing himself as Outis: 

> My name is Outis

Outis being not only a shortened name form of Odys-seus, but also the Greek word meaning nobody. This aids in his ultimate escape where the fellow cyclops dismiss Polyphemus' calls for help to find nobody. 

### Code Stuff!

Enough literature, let's see some code!

Steps to becoming an expert in new languages:

1. Open GeeksForGeeks
2. Look up how to print: `hello world`
3. Repeat until you learned all langauges!

Like so:

```
std::cout << "hello world!" << std::endl;
print("Hello world!)
System.out.println("Hello world!);
printf("Hello world!\n");
```

### Class Goals

Some basic goals I hope to accomplish in this class are:

- [x] Meeting new people
- [ ] Learning how to work on big projects
- [ ] Learning how to work in groups
- [ ] Learn website development
